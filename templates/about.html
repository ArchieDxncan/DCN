                    your experience while staying within reasonable boundaries of fair play. However, it's your responsibility
                    to use them appropriately and in accordance with the game's rules.

                    We recommend using these macros for casual gameplay or practice scenarios, and we do not endorse any use
                    that could disrupt the gaming experience for others.
